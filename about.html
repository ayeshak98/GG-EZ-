	<p>The GG EZ team is made up of heardworking individuals with one goal in mind: to bring the gaming community together. Like any winning team, we too have exceptional people on our team, each specializing in certain tasks to keep this website fresh.</p>
	<p>We take pride in writing quality articles about our favorite games and bringing people closer with our common inerest in eSports and video games. We want to post honest reviews about various games we try out from time to time and hope to let our readers be able to post their very own reviews as well. We also hope to make our own YouTube channel in the future to post our own guides and gameplays to help other gamers improve in their favorite games.</p>
	<p>In order to bring others together we will be creating a "hangouts" page very soon where we will be posting multiple hangouts on different occasions for different games. Go ahead and sign your name on whatever hangouts catch your eye! You don't even have to play the game in order to go to a certain hangout! You can always go to the hangout and ask someone else about how to begin the game. There is no shame in being a noob! We've all been there!</p>
	<p>Thank you for your interest in GG EZ and happy gaming!</p>
